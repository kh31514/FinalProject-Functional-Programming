Install instructions:

After unzipping the source code, run "make build".

If the terminal prompts an error message, you likely need to install packages. Try running the following commands:
* opam install ounit2
* opam install ANSITerminal
* opam install pyml
* opam install yojson

For Mac: If python is not loading correctly make sure you are using the correct Unix shell. May encounter error using bash instead of zsh.

Now, you should be able to run "make listen" to begin your musical journey. Further instructions will be provided in the terminal.
