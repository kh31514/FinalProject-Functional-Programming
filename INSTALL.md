Install instructions:

After unzipping the source code, run "make build".

If the terminal prompts an error message, you likely need to install packages. Try running the following commands:
* opam install ounit2
* opam install ANSITerminal
* opam install pyml
* opam install yojson

Now, you should be able to run "make listen" to begin your musical journey. Further instructions will be provided in the terminal.
